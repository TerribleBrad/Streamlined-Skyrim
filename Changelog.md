Streamlined is compiled with the new update! New UI! First person combat is no longer supported. Streamlined Skyrim is designed for third person combat so now you are forced to use it. Weapons and Armors now have some new tweaks. Flora and Fauna have gotten a face-lift with the addition of Renthal's old mods. Fixed MoreHud not being in mcm. Couldn't get the settings loader to work so its back to manual setup. Quicksave is now a regular save. Waiting and sleeping is faster.
             
            NEW SAVE IS REQUIRED because of perk tree changes made by Hand to Hand

#### Streamlined Skyrim 1.1.0

I've made so many changes it's not even worth writing each one here, but here is the gist of it:

Streamlined Skyrim was in dire need of a visual revamp. One of the main selling points of the list is that it was performance friendly, but I broke something and the fps got terrible. So I removed a large amount of mods and rebuilt the list from the ground up. In my humble opinion, Streamlined Skyrim now looks significantly better visually and now it performs much better then it once did.

Some changes are:
Streamlined Skyrim is now compiled with Anniversary Edition Update! Yay, no more downgrade needed!
Trees, mountains and flora have been replaced with higher quality models & textures. Character appearance has been revamped. Many new texture choices have been made. New music has been added that fits nicely into the game. A number of mcms have been automated to simplify the installation process.

Major gameplay changes (not comprehensive whatsoever):
Removed Lawbringer, Open World Loot, and Wyrmstooth

Regenerated all files : Dyndolod, Texgen, Synthesis, and Nemesis
